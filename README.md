# API-for-Youtube-Video-Sentiment
This program exhibits the use of Youtube's API in order to gather all data regarding a specific Youtube Channel.
Enter your API key and the Channel ID for the Youtube Channel you would want to gather data from. 
The program then uses Bag of words to sort through a given Youtube title and determine if that title's sentiment is positive, negative or neutral
For the test data, I manually inputted what I percieved the specific Youtube title to be. (positive, negative, neutral).
Furthermore, there is a quick analysis on whether or not the title's sentiment may influence the Youtube video's performance
